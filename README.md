# Global-Target-Analysis-Matlab

Global target analysis is commonly used when attempting to model / fit / deconvolve transient absorption (TA) data, but can really be used in any case where the data is represented by a 2D matrix defined by two experimental dimensions. In the case case of TA these dimensions are wavelength and time.

This script is intended as a demonstrations of basic approaches to the global target analysis. It should not be used as-is, but instead studies and understood. The purpose of this script is only to provide a path to learning the global target analysis method.

If a more automated approach is required, there are some excellent toolboxes for global analysis out there (see below). A thorough understanding of the methodology is, however, strongly recommended before using any automated approaches / toolboxes.

## Things to watch out for

- Just like with any modelling, overfitting is a problem. _'With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make it wiggle its trunk'_ - Jonny von Neumann (See [Drawing an elephant with four complex parameters](https://publications.mpi-cbg.de/Mayer_2010_4314.pdf), Mayer et al. _American Journal of Physics_ 78, 648 (2010), DOI: [10.1119/1.3254017](https://www.doi.org/10.1119/1.3254017))
- Local minima are very much of a problem in fitting / regression in general. Global target analysis is particularity susceptible to this problem since it deals with multidimensional **and** non-linear models. The code here uses a basic simplex solver (`fminseach`) but, in general, one ought to consider a way of ensuring the solution is a global (putative) minimum. This can, for example, be achieved by using a solver more adapted to finding global minima (e.g. `patternsearch`) or using an exploratory algorithm (e.g. `ga`) to understand better the behaviour of the particular fitting problem.
- Global analysis as shown here assumes that parameters of the model in one dimension are invariant in the other. For example, the species-associated spectra are invariant in time (bar the scaling by the fraction of species present)
